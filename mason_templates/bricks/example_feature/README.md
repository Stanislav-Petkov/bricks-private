# example_feature

To generate the files from it, go to your project's main folder and run the commands:

`mason init`
`mason add example_feature --git-url https://github.com/CreoTech-Group/bricks --git-path mason_templates/bricks/example_feature`
`mason make example_feature`

Notes for a brick with name `example_feature`:
`mason init` will create `mason.yaml` file.
`mason add` will set the location of the brick code in the mason.yaml
`mason make` will generate the structure of the brick in your project's `lib` folder and it will
prompt to enter the needed variables from the brick configuration, such as the name of the feature
and the name of the repository.
It will generate `.mason` folder and `mason-lock.json` file
The presentation layer part of the feature will be generated from the `presentation_layer` brick

After the brick is generated register your `FeatureClient` in the `RestModule` class
like this:
`
@lazySingleton
FeatureClient featureClient(Dio dio) {
  return FeatureClient(dio);
}
`
And then run the build generator
